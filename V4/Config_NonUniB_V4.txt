1) Radius of Beam: 20cm, Position of Beam: Z=+65cm
2) Incidence angle: CosZ between [-1;-.0.70]
3) Non-Uniform Magnetic field: uses 5mm step field map
4) Propagation step = 100 microns
5) Atmosphere is Nitrogen only
6) Try to fill T2 with C3F8 gas and propagate particles
7) The geometry has been updated from the measurements and solidwork from James Roth
8) The shell (isofoam + aluminium alloy) is modeled
